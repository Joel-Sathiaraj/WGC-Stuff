# WGC-Stuff
All the code and tools I have used for WGC purposes with helpful guides.

The first section of this repository has to do with Crossword construction and hosting. The second section has code required for correction of submitted codes. Other folders will be added in the future. Scrabble wordlists maybe uploaded at some point in time.
